      <a href='links.html'>links</a> and <a href='misc/extras.html'>useful extras</a>.</p>

    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.jpg' width='75' alt='A mochi ball in a bubble'/>

    <h2>GIFs</h2>
    <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.gif' width='75' alt='A dancing mochi ball'/>

    <h2>PNGs</h2>
    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.png' width='75' alt='A mochi ball'/>

    <!-- ATTRIBUTES IN THE "img/" ELEMENTS
    1. We can use the "img/" element’s "width" attribute to get intended size.
    There’s a corresponding height attribute, as well. Setting only one of them
    will cause the image to scale proportionally, while defining both will stretch
    the image. Dimension values are specified in pixels, and you should never
    include a unit. It's usually better to set image dimenstion with CSS so you
    can alter them with media queries (more later)
    2. Adding "alt" attributes to "img/" elements is best practice. It defines a
    “text alternative” to the image being displayed.
    3. A web page’s default language is defined by the lang attribute on the top-level
    <html> element. Our document is in English, so we’ll use the en country code as the
    attribute value.
    4. A “character set” is kind of like a digital alphabet for your browser. It’s different
    from the language of your document in that it only affects how the letters themselves are
    rendered, not the language of the content.-->
