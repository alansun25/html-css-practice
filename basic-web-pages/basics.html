<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- tell browsers that this is an HTML5 web page; always needs to look exactly like this -->
<html> <!-- html tags must wrap the entire webpage; this is the opening tag -->
  <head>
    <!-- Metadata goes here (head contains all metadata like page title, and CSS stylesheets, and other things needed to render the page
    but you don't necessarily want the user to see) -->
      <title>Interneting Is Easy!</title> <!-- Browsers display the title element in the page tab and Google search display; this
      element should always be in <head> -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content goes here (bulk of html markup; visible content of the page) -->
      <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1> <!-- heading element is displayed on page; there are sixe levels of headings: h1 to h6,
      the higher the number the less prominent the heading -->
      <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p> <!-- paragraph element marks text inside as distinct paragraph; must be
      in <body> element -->

      <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>Headings define the outline of the site. There are six levels of headings: h1 to h6. By default, browsers render less important headings in smaller fonts.</p>

      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <p>This is how you make an UNORDERED list:</p>
      <ul>
        <!-- <ul> tells browser it's a list; <li> indicates individual items in the list -->
        <li>Add a "ul" element (stands for unordered lists)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        <li> "ul" elements can ONLY contain "li" elements</li>
        <li> So, if you want a paragraph in a "ul", wrap it with an "li", like so:</li>
        <li><p>This is a "p" element wrapped in an "li" element</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is what an ORDERED list looks like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
      <!-- <em> stands for emphasis (typically italics) -->
      <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word of phrase.</p>
      <!-- <strong> makes text bold -->
      <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word of phrase.</p>
      <!-- You can also next strong inside of em, or vice versa -->
      <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

      <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
      <p>The HTML tags we’ve encountered so far either wrap text content (e.g., "p") or other HTML elements (e.g., "ol").
      That’s not the case for all HTML elements. Some of them can be “empty“ or “self-closing”. Line breaks and horizontal
      rules are the most common empty elements you’ll find.</p>
      <p>To tell the browser that we want a hard line break, we need to use an explicit "br/" element.</p>
      <p>Sincerely, (there's a  "br/" element here in the code)<br/>

      <!-- Don't abuse the br/ tag; for example, don't use it to add a bunch of space between paragraphs - this will
      be defined in CSS. -->
      <p> The  "hr/" element is the "horizontal rule", which represents a thematic break. The transition from one scene of a
      story to the next or between the end of a letter and a postscript are good examples of when a horizontal rule may be
      appropriate. For example:</p>

      <hr/>

      <p>P.S. This  page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with CSS soon. (There's an "hr/" tag above the P.S. in the code.)</p>

      <p>"hr/" default appearance is a horizontal line, but this can be modified with CSS later.</p>
